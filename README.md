I was the lead engineer for competitive validation for Cisco SD-WAN with SASE against Palo Alto's SD-WAN with Prisma Access (Formally known as CloudGenix SD-WAN.

Cisco SASE connects cloud applications with users and devices anywhere in the network. Miercom independently assessed the functionality, performance and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of Cisco’s SD-WAN with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution finding it offered significant benefits for the modern branch network and remote worker solution. This was seen in terms of ease of deployment, architecture that is simple to operate and manage, scalability, and the latest built-in security features – making it the perfect choice for customers.
